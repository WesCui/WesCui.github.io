I'm a first year postgraduate student from [NWPU]((https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/)). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [LiangWang](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/2023050014.html) of the Lab from [School of Cybersecurity]([https://cs.pku.edu.cn/](https://wlkjaqxy.nwpu.edu.cn/)), Northwestern Polytechnical University. 

You can find my CV here: [WesCui's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
