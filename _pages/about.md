I'm a first year postgraduate student from [NWPU](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by LiangWang of the Lab from [School of Cybersecurity](https://wlkjaqxy.nwpu.edu.cn/), Northwestern Polytechnical University. 

This is my personal blog which I use to record my learning experiences and study notes. 

I will also share some interesting ideas in this website. 

Currently I am interested in Machine Learning(ML), having learned about Deep Learning (DL)before, and I am currently teaching myself Reinforcement Learning(RL). 

If you are interested in related content, please feel free to send me an email to discuss. 

In the future, I plan to update some interesting algorithmic questions and knowledge related to back-end development, and of course some Machine Learning thoughts.
